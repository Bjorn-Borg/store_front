This is the repository for BjÃ¶rn Borg's headless solution project. Follow this README for setting it up and scripts.

### Available scripts

```
npm run dev
npm run performance
```

### Version control

This project is version controled in github and should follow the standard master > development > branching pattern. New updates to the project should go through pull requests, should be test covered, should not break any tests, and should comply with the performance threshold.

### Design pattern

The project leverages the nextJS routing and uses pages structure to organize each view.
The project is TDD. Every new feature needs unit, integration and e2e tests before merging to development.

### Next steps on setup

Setting a docker container to run this project in
Set the first test suites in Jest and Cypress

### Default nextJS instructions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

This is the repository for BjÃ¶rn Borg's headless solution project. Follow this README for setting it up and scripts information.

## Available scripts

```
npm run dev
npm run performance
npm run dev:test
npm run lint
```

## Version control

This project is version controled in github and should follow the standard master > development > branching pattern. New updates to the project should go through pull requests, and every commit should be test covered, comply with linter, should not break any tests, and should comply with the performance threshold.

## Quality Assurance

#### Commit treadmill:

On every commit the following scripts are run:

1.  The linter:

```
npm run lint
```

It will check for typos and code syntax warnings and actual errors and will stop the commit in two scenarios:

- There are errors
- There are more than 10 warnings

2. The jest test suites:

```
npm run test:pc
```

It will run all the suites that are related to the staged files for that commit and expect those files to have a minimum coverage. It will exit the commit in two scenarios:

- Any of the tests don't pass
- The coverage threshold is not met

3. The lighthouse tests:

```
npm run performance
```

It will run the lighthouse test suite in quiet and headless mode and save the scores of that commit in the LighthouseReports.csv file. It will exit the commit in two scenarios:

- The lighthouse fails to run, which means the project is not compiling
- One of the lighthouse scores threshold was not met

#### Git hooks

After cloning the repository run the following commands to make the git hooks executable:

- Change the path for the git hooks to the folder .githooks (this allows sharing the hooks):

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

- Make the hook executable:

```
chmod +x .githooks/*
```

This should be ran for any new hook, by everyone using it.

- In case you are to create a new hook follow this example executing all commands from root:

1. Create a new file inside .githooks/ in root with the name of the hook. You can use the following cli command substituting pre-push for the name of the hook you want to create:

```
touch .githooks/pre-push
```

2. Make the new hook file executable by running the following command:

```
chmod +x .githooks/*
```

3. Add content to your new hook file. Samples can be found inside .git/hooks and .githooks.

## Design pattern

The project leverages the nextJS routing and uses pages structure to organize each view.
The project is TDD. Every new feature needs unit, integration and e2e tests before merging to development.

### UI library

The project is addapted to use Mateial UI and should also be able to use AMP's UI components.

## Next steps on setup

- Set the first test suites in Cypress.
- Finish the pre-commit and pre-merge treadmills.
- Set up environments

### .env

The analytics script requires the environment variable GA_TRACKING_ID, the should hold the google analytics ID.

## TDD

To run unit and integration tests with jest in watch mode run the following script:

```
npm run dev:test
```

#### ESlint

The linter is set to run on every commit but I would also suggest running it more frequently to avoid ammounting lint fixes to the point of commit. To run the linter run the following script (with docker running):

```
npm run lint
```

#### Test coverage

The jest testing coverage right now is set to

- 80% functions
- 80% branches
- 80% lines
- -10 statements

If this threshold is not met the test suite will fail and the commit will be aborted.
If it is needed to change this threshold these values can be found in coverageThreshold in jest.config.js.
The coverageThreshold is set globaly, but can also be set to specific directories or files if needed.
For more config options check [jest docks](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#coveragethreshold-object)

#### Performance monitoring flow

The performance script is set to run on every commit. The hook will run google lighthouse and save the test results in a json file and an html file that can be opened in the browser. The files are saved localy in LighthouseOutput.
The resulting scores for the test are assessed and if any of the scores don't achieve the minimum standard it will break the commit. If the scores meet the requirements, they are saved in the LighthouseReports.csv in the root, and should be saved in the repo. Along with the scores the script will save the date and commit id so that performance changes can be tracked down in the commit tree.

- One thing to watch for
  How the csv file is going to behave during merges is still unkown, therefore, merges should be dealt with using caution. It is best to manually merge the file in the first attempts and then write a script for it later if it is needed.

### Default nextJS instructions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Docker Container

This project runs in a docker container. There is a <i>Dockerfile</i> that containerize the application, and a <i>docker-compose.yml</i>
that exposes the port and creates the volumes of the container.  
To start the project in the container, run:

`npm run dev:start`

and to stop it, you can either type Ctrl-X, or in a new terminal run:

`npm run dev:stop`

In case you need to install any dependencies to the project, in the terminal type:

`docker exec -it storefront /bin/bash`

and then you have a bash session inside the container. Once in there you can <i>npm install</i> dependencies as usual, and it will update the <i>packege.json</i> file.
